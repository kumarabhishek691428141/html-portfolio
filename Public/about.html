<H1>About Me</H1>
<p>The Animal Rescue League of Boston (ARL) boasts a rich history. <br>
    It was founded back in 1899 by Anna Harris Smith, a social worker <br>
    who wished to combat the mistreatment of horses and the sheer volume <br>
     of stray dogs and cats in the city. </p>

<p> ARL does a terrific job of sharing its 125-year history of support for <br>
    animals on its About Us page, which is rich with photo collections from the <br>
    past to the present. The links to assets invite the user to learn more about <br>
    ARL’s cause. For instance, the impact report is a one-pager that proves its <br>
    support for over 20,000 animals in Massachusetts alone. At the end of the page, <br>
    leadership photos featuring pets are a nice touch to reinforce ARL’s commitment to <br>
    helping animals. This About Us page is an example of how to show front-and-center <br>
    your mission and pluck the heartstrings of your audience with just the right content.</p>
